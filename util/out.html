<p><strong>Zizek and Daly 2004</strong></p>
<p>(Slavoj, PhD in Philosophy @ the University of Ljubljana, Senior Research in Sociology @ the University of Ljubljana, Professor of Philosophy and Psychoanalysis @ the European Graduate School, has been a visiting professor @ University of Chicago, Columbia University, Princeton, University of London, and NYU, International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, president of the Society for Theoretical Psychoanalysis, and Glyn, has been a Professor @ Essex University and Manchester University, Conversations with Zizek page 14-16)</p>
<p>For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol and recognize that <span class="underline">our ethico-political responsibility is to confront the constitutive violence of</span> today’s <span class="underline">global capitalism and its</span> obscene naturalization / <span class="underline">anonymization of the millions</span> who are <span class="underline">subjugated by it</span> throughout the world. Against the standardized positions of postmodern culture – with all its pieties concerning ‘multiculturalist’ etiquette – Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called ‘radically incorrect’ in the sense that it break with these types of positions 7 and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of today’s social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long, Marxism has been bedeviled by an almost fetishistic economism that has tended towards political morbidity. With the likes of Hilferding and Gramsci, and more recently Laclau and Mouffee, crucial theoretical advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of implicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, the fear of economism can end up reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary capitalism (i.e. the initial prohibition conjures up the very thing it fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to economism. Zizek’s point is rather that in rejecting economism <span class="underline">we should not lose sight of the</span> systemic <span class="underline">power of capital in shaping</span> the lives and destinies of <span class="underline">humanity</span> and our very sense of the possible. In particular we should not overlook Marx’s central insight that in order <span class="underline">to create a universal</span> global <span class="underline">system</span> the forces of <span class="underline">capitalism seek to conceal the</span> politico-discursive <span class="underline">violence of its construction</span> through a kind of gentrification of that system. What is persistently denied by neo-liberals such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that the <span class="underline">gentrification of</span> global liberal <span class="underline">capitalism is one whose ‘universalism’</span> fundamentally reproduces and depends upon a disavowed violence that <span class="underline">excludes vast</span> sectors of the world’s <span class="underline">populations.</span> In this way, neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes of winning and losing as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgment in a neutral market place. Capitalism does indeed create a space for a certain diversity, at least for the central capitalist regions, but it is neither neutral nor ideal and its price in terms of social exclusion is exorbitant. That is to say, <span class="underline">the</span> human <span class="underline">cost in</span> terms of inherent global <span class="underline">poverty and degraded ‘life-chances’ cannot be calculated within the existing economic rationale</span> and, in consequence, social exclusion remains mystified and nameless (viz. the patronizing reference to the ‘developing world’). And Zizek’s point is that this mystification is magnified through capitalism’s profound capacity to ingest its own excesses and negativity: to redirect (or misdirect) social antagonisms and to absorb them within a culture of differential affirmation. Instead of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle. Against this Zizek argues for a new universalism whose primary ethical directive is to confront the fact that our forms of social existence are founded on exclusion on a global scale. While it is perfectly true that universalism can never become Universal (it will always require a hegemonic-particular embodiment in order to have any meaning), what is novel about Zizek’s universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix.</p>

<p>The contradiction of <span class="underline">capitalism</span> is that it <span class="underline">is an <strong>uncompromising structure of negotiation</strong>. It ruthlessly <strong>absorbs</strong> sociohistorical limits and the challenges these limits pose to capital, placing them in the <strong>service of further capital accumulation</strong>. Neoliberalism is an exclusive system</span> premised upon the logic of property rights and the expansion of these rights, all the while <span class="underline">maintaining that the free market is self-regulating</span>, sufficiently and efficiently working to establish individual and collective well-being. <span class="underline">In reality, however, socioeconomic disparities have become more acute the world over, and the world's &quot;common wealth,&quot;</span> as David Bollier and later Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri note, <span class="underline">has been increasingly privatized</span>.12 In 2010, the financial wealth of the world's high-net-worth individuals (with invest- able assets of $1 to $50 million or more [all money amounts are in U.S. dollars]) surpassed the 2007 pre-financial crisis peak, growing 9.7 percent and reaching $42.7 trillion. Also in 2010 the global population of high-net- worth individuals grew 8.3 percent to 10.9 million.13 In 2010, the global population was 6.9 billion, of whom there were 1,000 billionaires; 80,000 ultra-high-net-worth individuals with average wealth exceeding $50 million; 3 billion with an average wealth of $10,000, of which 1.1 billion owned less than $1,000; and 2.5 billion who were reportedly &quot;unbanked&quot; (without a bank account and thus living on the margins of the formal financial system).14 In a world where financial advantage brings with it political benefits, these figures attest to the weak position the majority of the world occupies in the arena of environmental and climate change politics. <span class="underline">Neoliberal capitalism ameliorates the threat posed by environmental change by <strong>taking control</strong> of the collective call it issues forth, <strong>splintering the collective</strong> into a disparate and confusing array of individual choices competing with one another over how best to solve the crisis. Through this process of competition, the collective nature of the crisis is restructured</span> [END PAGE 5] <span class="underline">and privatized, then put to work for the production and circulation of capital as the average wealth of the world's high-net-worth individuals grows at the expense of the majority of the world living in abject poverty. Advocating that the free market can solve</span> debilitating environmental changes and <span class="underline">the climate crisis is not a political response to these problems; it is merely a <strong>political ghost emptied of its collective aspirations</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Cap maximizes wealth centralization—key internal link to poverty</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wolff ’11</strong> Richard D. Wolff, Professor of Economics Emeritus, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and currently a Visiting Professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs of the New School University in New York, “Capitalism and Poverty,” MR Zine, 11/10/2011, <a href="http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/wolff111011.html" class="uri">http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2011/wolff111011.html</a></p>
<p>Deepening poverty has multiple causes, but the capitalist economic system is major among them. First, <span class="underline">capitalism's periodic crises always increase poverty, and the current crisis is no exception</span>. More precisely, <span class="underline">how capitalist corporations operate, in or out of crisis, regularly reproduces poverty. At the top of every corporation, its major shareholders</span> (15-20 or fewer) <span class="underline">own controlling blocs of shares. They select a board of directors</span> -- usually 15-20 individuals -- <span class="underline">who run the corporation. These two tiny groups make all the key decisions: what, how, and where to produce and what to do with the profits.</span> Poverty is one result of this capitalist type of enterprise organization. For example, <span class="underline">corporate decisions generally aim to lower the number of workers or their wages or both. They automate, export</span> (outsource) jobs, <span class="underline">and replace higher-paid workers by recruiting</span> domestic and foreign <span class="underline">substitutes willing to work for less</span>. These normal corporate actions generate rising poverty as the other side of rising profits. When poverty and its miseries &quot;remain always with us,&quot; workers tend to accept what employers dish out to avoid losing jobs and falling into poverty. <span class="underline">Another major corporate goal is to control politics. Wherever all citizens can vote, workers' interests might prevail over those of directors and shareholders in elections. To prevent that, corporations devote portions of their revenues to finance politicians, parties, mass media, and &quot;think tanks.&quot; Their goal is to &quot;shape public opinion&quot; and control what government does</span>. They do not want Washington's crisis-driven budget deficits and national debts to be overcome by big tax increases on corporations and the rich. Instead public discussion and politicians' actions are kept focused chiefly on cutting social programs for the majority. Corporate goals include providing high and rising salaries, stock options, and bonuses to top executives and rising dividends and share prices to shareholders. <span class="underline">The less paid to the workers who actually produce what corporations sell, the more corporate revenue goes to satisfy directors, top managers, and major shareholders.</span> Corporations also raise profits regularly by increasing prices and/or cutting production costs (often by compromising output quality). <span class="underline">Higher priced and poorer-quality goods are sold mostly to working people. This</span> too <span class="underline">pushes them toward poverty just like lower wages and benefits and government service cuts.</span></p>
